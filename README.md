# Azure AI Security Demo: Perimeter Control with Azure AI Foundry and API Management

## üéØ Scenario Overview

Contoso Corporation is deploying an internal AI-powered assistant using Azure AI Foundry. To protect sensitive data, they want to ensure the AI model is only accessible through trusted channels. This demo shows how to:

- Restrict public access to Azure AI Foundry
- Use Azure API Management (APIM) as a secure gateway
- Enforce perimeter control using Azure Network Security Perimeter (NSP)

## üß± Architecture

- **Azure AI Foundry**: Hosts the AI model, with public access disabled.
- **Azure API Management**: Gateway for secure access to the AI model.
- **Network Security Perimeter**: Restricts inbound traffic to Foundry, allowing only APIM.
- **Key Vault & Storage**: Required dependencies for Foundry.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

You now have a secure Azure AI deployment:

- AI model is protected from public access
- Only APIM can reach the model
- All traffic is logged and controlled
